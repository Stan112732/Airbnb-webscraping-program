This is a program that I developped with my co-workers for our first year of master degree's final project, which allow users to get data from airbnb's website and to clean it, in order to analyse these data by changing only a few key words.  

This program can get airbnb tourist datas of a destination from different period and analyse the origin of tourists, 
their other habituel destinations, and to see how great events gonna influence the tourist flow. 
This program is a composed program which need both R and python language environment, so be sure to get 
all these before you use it. 
For now all the comments in the programme is written in french, I will do some translations if someone need it hardly. 
To use this program, it is highly commanded that you execute the file "InstallationPack.R"  first to make sure 
you have all packages needed in this program before you proceed to the main program. 
Once you have it all, get to "main.R' and replace the configurations by something you want to change into
 ( replace the zone "saint-barthelemy" by "Los Angeles" for exemple). If you need to find out tourists' other habituel destinations, 
please read the guide to configure your python to this R project before you use python to get them. 
This program is inspired by the application designed by Alexandre Cebeillac et Yvette Vaguet
 (https://journals.openedition.org/eps/10452) and developped with the help of our tutor Mme. Delphine Grancher. 
Let me know if you have any questions and advices.
